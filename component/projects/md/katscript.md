Inspired by game development frameworks, this was a research project that presents a domain-specific language, compiler, and runtime system that abstracts over some important aspects of game development. The language features a strong functional programming framework that is used to express object-oriented and event-driven programming design patterns. The language is not designed to be state-of-the-art, and there is much that could be improved.
