This website is used as my homepage and portfolio site. Currently I host [social media links](/content/contact.html), [project information](/content/projects.html) and [a blog](/content/blog/posts.html).

The site uses plain HTML and CSS with very little JavaScript. Additionally, a custom site generator was created using Ruby and was used to maintain consistency between pages. Ruby also helped reduce the burden of creating content by parsing information from other file formats, such as YAML or Markdown. A mature web development framework, such as Rails, Django or React, was not used since they are overkill for my purposes.

My design goals are to be simple and clean, therefore JavaScript and CSS animations were reserved purely for non-essential features.
